Welcome to the Quality Assurance (QA) Guide. This document serves as a comprehensive resource for ensuring that our products meet the highest standards of quality, reliability, and performance. Whether you're a new team member or an experienced QA professional, this guide outlines our approach to software testing, including processes, tools, standards, and best practices.

The goal is to prevent defects, identify issues early, and deliver software that consistently meets user expectations and business requirements. By following the guidelines outlined here, we promote a culture of quality across the development lifecycle—from planning and development to deployment and maintenance.

Let’s work together to build better, more reliable software.

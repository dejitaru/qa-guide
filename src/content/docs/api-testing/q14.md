API testing involves testing the application programming interfaces (APIs) to ensure they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security. It includes:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Functional Testing:</strong> Verifying API endpoints perform as expected.</li>
        <li><strong>Load Testing:</strong> Testing API performance under load.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Testing:</strong> Ensuring API is secure from attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation Testing:</strong> Validating API responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Fuzz Testing:</strong> Testing API with unexpected inputs.</li>
      </ul>

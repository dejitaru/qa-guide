Some common test case design techniques include:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Equivalence Partitioning:</strong> Dividing input data into partitions and testing one condition from each partition.</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary Value Analysis:</strong> Testing the boundaries between partitions.</li>
        <li><strong>Decision Table Testing:</strong> Testing combinations of inputs and their corresponding outputs.</li>
        <li><strong>State Transition Testing:</strong> Testing the behavior of a system as it transitions from one state to another.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Case Testing:</strong> Testing based on user scenarios.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Testing:</strong> Simultaneously learning, designing, and executing tests.</li>
      </ul>

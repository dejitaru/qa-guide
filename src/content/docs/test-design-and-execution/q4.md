<ul>
        <li><strong>Prioritize:</strong> Focus on critical and high-risk test cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Automate:</strong> Use automation tools to run repetitive tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk-Based Testing:</strong> Identify and test the most critical functionalities first.</li>
        <li><strong>Smoke Testing:</strong> Perform a quick set of tests to ensure the basic functionality works.</li>
        <li><strong>Parallel Testing:</strong> If possible, run tests in parallel to save time.</li>
      </ul>

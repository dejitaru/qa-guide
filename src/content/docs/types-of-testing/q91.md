Exploratory testing is done when:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Requirements are Unclear:</strong> To understand the application better.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> When there is limited time for formal test case design.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Systems:</strong> To explore complex functionalities that are hard to script.</li>
        <li><strong>New Features:</strong> To quickly test new features or changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bug Hunting:</strong> To find unexpected bugs that scripted tests might miss.</li>
      </ul>
